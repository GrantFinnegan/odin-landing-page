# odin-landing-page
Landing page exercise as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course

The goal of this project is to utilize knowledge of CSS, particularly Flexbox, to build a readable, stylish, and reactive landing page.

## Post exercise reflection
Over the course of this exercise I've demonstrated, solidified, and expanded my understanding of CSS and Flexbox, as well as the use of Git and Github. I've additionally demonstrated an attention to detail and commitment which I believe will serve me well. Even if I may have gotten a bit carried away on this exercise.

To myself, I have demonstrated an ability to work on these problems, and to maintain an eye for detail even in chaotic surroundings. The time I've spent learning web development has coincided with the last months of my father's life. And the confidence I have gained through simultaneously caring for him and progressing on this front is something I will carry with me into the future, and any chaos it might bring.

I incorporated aspects of creative writing on this exercise, by creating a cyberpunk, dystopian, darkly comic narrative behind the site. This was mostly for my own amusement, but gave me a context for why my design decisions were important. And it alerted me to new ways in which not only static but dynamic and technical elements of web design can interact with the communicative goals of clients/employers.

I have identified several current blind spots and areas for growth. I will be researching more details about best practices for code readability, responsive design, git commit etiquette, and git repository management and structuring. Additionally, I got bogged down in details that were admittedly not necessary for a practice web page at this point in my learning journey. These details will be worth focusing on eventually, but for now I will focus my efforts on building a strong foundation of knowledge in a timely manner.
